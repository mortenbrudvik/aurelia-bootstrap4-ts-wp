# aurelia-bootstrap4-ts-wp
Simple SPA application with a navbar and a footer. Created with Bootstrap, Aurelia, Typescript and Webpack.

## Building

* Clone it
* Go into the directory
* Run `npm install` or `yarn`
* Run `au run --watch` to start it up on port 8080
* or Run `au build --env prod` to build it to folder dist.

NB! `au run` without the --watch is currently broken. Webpack issue..
